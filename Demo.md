# AnimalGAN Project Demo
**Introduction:**
Welcome to the AnimalGAN project demo. In this demonstration, we will guide you through the process of setting up the environment, running the code available in this repository on real data, and showcasing the expected output.

**Prerequisites:**
Before we begin, please ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Conda Installation:** Make sure you have Conda installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

**Environment Setup:**
1. **Create a Conda Environment:** Set up a dedicated Conda environment for the AnimalGAN project using the provided YAML file (`environment.yml`):

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. **Activate the Environment:** Activate the Conda environment you just created:

   ```bash
   conda activate AnimalGAN
   ```

   Please note that the time required for installation and environment setup may vary depending on factors such as your internet speed and computer performance. Typically, Conda installation takes only a few minutes, encompassing the download, installation, and configuration of the base Conda environment.

   In my experience, recreating the environment using the provided YAML file took approximately 15 minutes. However, these times are approximate and can differ based on individual circumstances. If you have a faster internet connection and a powerful computer, the setup process may be quicker.

**Running the Code:**
Now that we have our Conda environment set up, let's run the AnimalGAN code on real data. Follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Start by preparing your dataset.
   - Place the dataset files in the designated `Data` folder.
   - We have provided a small example dataset there to show you the format and help you get started.

   **Molecular Descriptors:**
   - When developing AnimalGAN, numeric molecular descriptors are required.
   - For this study, we employed a set of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors generated by Mordred.
   - When using AnimalGAN to generate clinical pathology measurements for a given treatment condition (the combination of compound structure, sacrifice period, and dose level), the Mordred descriptors of the given compound are also needed.

   **Obtaining Molecular Representations:**
   - You can use Structure-Data File (SDF) to obtain the molecular representations if you have the SDF of the interested compound.
   - We provide a Python script `calMolDes.py` for your reference.
   - If you only have the compound name, you can refer to the Python script `getSDF.py` to get the SDF for your interested compound first.

2. **Configuration:**
   - If needed, configure the model parameters and settings by editing the configuration files.

3. **Training:**
   - Start training the AnimalGAN model on your dataset using the following command:

     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```

   - You can monitor the training progress and metrics during the process.

   - Additionally, you can plot the losses and generated valid ratios using the following command:

     ```bash
     python plotLoss.py
     ```

   - The expected figure will look like this:

     [Include an image or description of the expected figure]

These revisions provide more clarity regarding each step of the demo, making it easier for users to follow along. Additionally, consider including a sample image or description of the expected figure for the "plotLoss.py" output to give users a visual reference.
